            <div>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technology that combines information retrieval and generative artificial intelligence (such as large language models). The main purpose is to enhance the output of the generative AI model by retrieving relevant information from the external knowledge base, so as to provide more accurate, relevant and customized answers. Specifically, the workflow of RAG includes the following steps: the user asks a question, and the system finds the document fragments most relevant to the problem from external data sources (such as databases, documents or the Internet) through the retrieval module; then, these retrieved information will be integrated into the input of the generated model to generate the model. Then generate answers based on this information. This method enables RAG to use a large amount of information in addition to the initial training data, thus improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated content. RAG technology has been applied in many fields, such as dialogue search, content creation, legal research, financial analysis, etc. It can not only provide the latest information, but also reduce the illusion phenomenon in the content generated by AI. However, RAG also faces some challenges, such as limited database coverage, retrieval problems, data bias, etc. RAG is a powerful technology that significantly improves the performance and application scope of generative models by combining information retrieval and generative AI.</div>
